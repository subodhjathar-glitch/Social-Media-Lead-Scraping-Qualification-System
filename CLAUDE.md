### Plan & Review

**Before starting work:**
- Always enter plan mode to create a detailed implementation plan
- Write the plan to `.claude/tasks/TASK_NAME.md`
- The plan should include:
  - Detailed implementation steps with reasoning
  - Tasks broken down into manageable pieces
  - Research findings for external knowledge or packages (use Task tool for research)
- Think MVP - don't over-plan
- **IMPORTANT:** After writing the plan, ask for user review and approval. Do not continue implementation until the plan is approved.

**While implementing:**
- Update the plan as you work
- After completing tasks, append detailed descriptions of the changes made to the plan file
- This ensures following tasks can be easily handed over to other engineers
